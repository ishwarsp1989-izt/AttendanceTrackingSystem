* Dates: java.util.Date and java.time.LocalDate
	- LocalDate-> Recently Included in Java8 . Includes only year, month, and date. Much cleaner handling API. Use java.time.LocalTime for handling time.
	- util.Date -> Wrapper around 'long', contains info down to milliseconds. Includes time of day info.
	- util.LocalDateTime -> Info of both Date and Times.
	- java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter
	- Duration.between(LocalDate,LocalDate)
	
* Datatypes:
	- Primitive: 
		* Whole Numbers(byte, short, int, long)
		* Fractions (float, double)
		* boolean
		* char
	- NonPrimitive: String, Arrays, Collections..etc
	
* String.format("%s",date)

* 'this' is mostly to resolve conflict between local and global variables

====================
Why 'throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Time Format..");' is not expecting 'throws' at function level
